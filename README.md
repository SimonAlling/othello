# ⚫⚪ JS Othello ⚪⚫

I wrote an [Othello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) clone for the iPad back in 2011, when I was 17.
I think it can serve as a textbook example of how _not_ to write code … 😁 Looking at it a decade later as a professional software engineer with an MSc in computer science, I can barely fathom how I managed to get it working at all. 👀

## About the commit history

I had never heard about Git when I made this game; the commit history up to the addition of this readme is mechanically reconstructed from manual backups I created back in 2011 by simply copying the entire directory and zipping it.
The commit messages and dates are simply the file names of those zipped archives.

## About the game

I made the game specifically for my first-generation iPad with iOS 3.2, but – somewhat to my surprise – it turns out to work fairly well on my 2017 iPad Pro with iOS 15.4 (albeit with some issues, including that the settings menu cannot be closed).

The game is designed to look and feel like an iOS app (as of 2011), with a splash screen, an offline cache configuration and a first-class way to add a nice-looking icon to the home screen.
(Some of this seems to have broken at some point between iOS 3.2 and iOS 15.4.)
